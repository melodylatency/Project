# Customizable Forms Web Application

Welcome to the **Customizable Forms Web Application**, a platform where you can create, share, and fill out customizable forms, quizzes, questionnaires, and polls. Inspired by tools like Google Forms, this application allows users to design templates with various question types and share them with others to collect responses.

## Key Features

- **Create Templates**: Authenticated users can create custom templates with different question types (single-line text, multi-line text, integers, checkboxes, etc.). Templates can include titles, descriptions, images, tags, and access settings.
  
- **Fill Out Forms**: Authenticated users can fill out forms based on available templates. Responses are stored and can be viewed by the form creator, template creator, and admins.

- **Public and Restricted Templates**: Templates can be marked as "public" (accessible to all authenticated users) or restricted to specific users.

- **Admin Privileges**: Admins have full control over the platform. They can manage users (block/unblock, delete, promote/demote admins) and edit any template or form.

- **Comments and Likes**: Users can leave comments and like templates. Comments are automatically updated in real-time.

- **Multi-language and Themes**: The application supports two languages (English and one other) and two visual themes (light and dark).

- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on different devices, including mobile phones.

## How to Use

1. **Registration and Login**: To create templates or fill out forms, register and log in to the platform.
2. **Create a Template**: Go to your personal page, click "Create New Template," and add questions, descriptions, tags, and access settings.

## For Admins

- View all templates and forms as if they were the creator.
